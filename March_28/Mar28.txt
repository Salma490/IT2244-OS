1)Find Rows Containing "Engineering": grep "Engineering" data.csv 

Explanation:
grep searches for the pattern "Engineering" in the file data.csv and returns all matching rows.

	
2)Find the number of columns in the first row: awk -F, '{print NF; exit}' data.csv 
	
Explanation:
-F,: Uses comma , as the field delimiter.
NF: Refers to the number of fields (columns) in a row.
exit: Ensures only the first row is processed.
	
	
3)Find the number of columns in each row: awk -F ',' {print NF}' data.csv

Explanation:
Prints the number of fields (columns) for every row in the CSV.
	
	
4)Sort CSV by Salary in Reverse Order (Descending): sort -t',' -k4,4r data.csv

Explanation:
-t',': Sets comma as the field delimiter.
-k4,4: Sorts by the 4th column (Salary).
r: Sorts in reverse (descending) order lexicographically (not numerically).
	
	
5)Sort CSV by Salary in Ascending Order (Numerical): sort -t',' -k4,4n data.csv 

Explanation:
-n: Sorts numerically, from lowest to highest salary.

Note: Header might be incorrectly placed since sort treats it as a normal row.
	
	
6)Sort Without -n: Lexicographic Reverse Sort by Salary
	sort -t',' -k4,4 -r data.csv

Explanation:
Without -n, values like "50000" and "9000" are compared as text, which may lead to incorrect sorting
	
	
7)Correct Numerical Reverse Sort by Salary: sort -t',' -k4,4 -n -r data.csv 

Explanation:
-n: Ensures proper numeric comparison.
-r: Reverse order (highest to lowest).
Header may be placed last because "Salary" isnâ€™t numeric.
	
	
8)Multi-Level Reverse Sort (Department, then Name): sort -t',' -k5,5 -k2,2 -r data.csv 

Explanation:
-k5,5: Sorts by Department (5th column).
-k2,2: If Department is the same, sorts by Name (2nd column).
-r: Applies reverse sort for all keys.
