Practical 02: Creating a Batch Script for Age Calculation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt the user for their birth year and calculate their current age based on the current date. 

@echo off
set /p birth_year=Enter your birth year:
set current_year=%date:~10,4%
set /a age=current_year - %birth_year%
echo your age is:%age%
pause

Explanation of the Script:

@echo off: Hides the command execution details for cleaner output.
set /p birth_year=...: Prompts the user to input their birth year and stores it in the birth_year variable.
%date:~10,4%: Extracts the current year from the system's date.
set /a age=current_year - %birth_year%: Calculates the user's age by subtracting their birth year from the current year.
echo Your age is: %age%: Displays the calculated age to the user.
pause: Pauses the script so the user can view the result before closing the window.
