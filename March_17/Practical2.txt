FILE PERMISSIONS IN LINUX
=========================

Linux file permissions control access using read, write, and execute rights, split among:
	owner
	group
	others.

Permission Types
-----------------

Read (r) 4: Allows the user to view the content of the file or list the contents of a directory
Write (w) 2: Allows the user to modify the file or add/delete files in a directory.
Execute (x) 1: Allows the user to execute a file as a program or enter a directory.


symbolicRepresentation:
-----------------------

ex: -rwxr-xr--

- : Regular file (use d for directory)
rwx : Owner – read, write, execute
r-x : Group – read, execute
r-- : Others – read


Octal (Numeric) Representation:
--------------------------------

 777    Full permissions for everyone            
 755    Full for owner, read/execute for others  
 644    Read/write for owner, read-only for others
 700    Full for owner, no access for others   

 

WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT - FILE ATTRIBUTES
========================================

ATTRIB – Used to view or change file attributes.

Steps:
	1.Create two files: abc.txt and xyz.txt.
	2.To hide abc.txt: ATTRIB +H abc.txt
	3.To make it visible again: ATTRIB -H abc.txt

Making a File Read-Only: ATTRIB +R abc.txt
This command makes abc.txt read-only; 
it cannot be edited unless the attribute is removed using: ATTRIB -R abc.txt
